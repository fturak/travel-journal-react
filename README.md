# Travel Journal - First React App

This is my [Firas Turak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/firasturak/) solution for a React based travel journal. It was my first project with React JS. The solution reads a local data file and maps the relevant data to their correct positions within reusable components "cards". The window is also fully responsive. In my next projects I plan to use fetch for data retrieval and hooks to expand my skills in React JS.
